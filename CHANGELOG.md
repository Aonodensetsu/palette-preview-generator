Version 1.0 - published to PyPI  
Versions from before publishing (0.x)  
Version 11 - since it's a library it needs a name, the main file got renamed to prev_gen  
Version 10 - fixed a namespacing bug, added docstrings, essentially a library now  
Version 9 - moved the classes to main, that third file was unnecessary  
Version 8 - changed hex to uppercase, file name to save into is a setting now  
Version 7 - added little corner descriptions as in Gruvbox, repositioned text a bit  
Version 6 - the rewrite update, the project is rewritten from scratch to fix any bugs and improve usability  
Version 5 - the README update, finally added the Usage section  
Version 4 - the little darker strip at the bottom goes a long way in making this look good  
Version 3 - finally fixed the font, Arial was making me angry, had to fix contrast again  
Version 2 - made in a day, got text contrast to about where I want it  
Version 1 - made in an hour, quality confirms it :p
