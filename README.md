# Information:

Creates a palette preview image by using an easy-to-use config file   
Based on the great [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme, where even the preview is impressive

# Usage:
You need **Python** with **pillow** module installed
1. Open up [pallete.py](palette.py) and set up the colors how you want (instruction in the file)  
2. Run either of the Python files to generate a palette
3. by default you will find your PNG in result.png

Simple as can be!
