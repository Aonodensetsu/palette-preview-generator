# Information:

Creates a palette preview image by using an easy-to-use config file  
Inspired by the great [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme, where even the preview is impressive

# Usage:
You need **Python 3.10+** with the **pillow** module installed
1. Open up [pallete.py](palette.py) and set up the colors how you want (instructions in the file)
2. Run either of the python files to start the app

You can also import [prev_gen.py](prev_gen.py) to use this as a library, simply pass an appropriate palette to the App class.  
Simple as can be!

# Changelog
