# Palette preview generator

Creates a palette preview image by using given color values  
Based on the great gruvbox theme, where even the preview is impressive:![gruvbox theme](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/410b3ab80570bcd5b470a08d84f93caa5b4962ccd994ebceeb3d1f78364c2120/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f776136363678672e706e67)

Version 4 - the little darker strip at the bottom goes a long way in making this look good

Archive of past results - to laugh or cry:

[Version 2](version2.png) - made in a day, got text contrast to about where I want it  
[Version 1](version1.png) - made in an hour, quality confirms it :p
