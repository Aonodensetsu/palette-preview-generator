# Information:

Creates a palette preview image by using an easy-to-use config file  
Inspired by the great [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme, where even the preview is impressive

# Usage:
You need **Python 3.10+** with the **pillow** module installed
1. Open up [palette.py](palette.py) and set up the colors how you want (instructions in the file)
2. Run either of the python files to start the app.

You can also import [prev_gen.py](prev_gen.py) to use this as a library, simply pass an appropriate palette to the PrevGen class.
Simple as can be!

# Changelog
Version 11 - since it's a library it needs a name, the main file got renamed to prev_gen  
![example](gruvbox.png)

Archive of past results - to laugh or cry:  
Version 10 - fixed a namespacing bug, added docstrings, essentially a library now  
Version 9 - moved the classes to main, that third file was unnecessary  
Version 8 - changed hex to uppercase, file name to save into is a setting now  
Version 7 - added little corner descriptions as in Gruvbox, repositioned text a bit  
Version 6 - the rewrite update, the project is rewritten from scratch to fix any bugs and improve usability  
Version 5 - the README update, finally added the Usage section  
Version 4 - the little darker strip at the bottom goes a long way in making this look good  
Version 3 - finally fixed the font, Arial was making me angry, had to fix contrast again  
Version 2 - made in a day, got text contrast to about where I want it  
Version 1 - made in an hour, quality confirms it :p
